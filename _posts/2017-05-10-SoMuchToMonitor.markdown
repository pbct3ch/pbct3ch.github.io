I'm working on a few new ideas around documenting the Defense side of InfoSec.  Everyday, I face the same strugles with time and resources.  A few of the topics that I will start 
documenting include:

* Log Monitoring Sources 
* IR Triage Tools 
* Creating A Security Program

I will start covering these topics over the next few weeks.
