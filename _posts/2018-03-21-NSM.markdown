Over the last year few years I have found myself implementing a combination of Security point products and Open-Source tools to supplement.  My favorite collection of open-source tools is the Security Onion NSM stack by Doug Burks.  I've been running this for the past 4 years and have come to depend on it.

I'm currently building a new 10G capable system that will have good retention for extended PCAP collection.  I will share the hardware buildout once we finalize the materials list.

Keep a lookout for the information in the next few weeks.
